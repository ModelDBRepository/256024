    "Active membrane conductances and morphology of a collision detection neuron broaden its impedance profile and improve discrimination of input synchrony" by Dewell and Gabbiani (2019) J Neurophysiol<br/>

It includes a detailed model of the lobula giant movement detector neuron (LGMD) which is a well studied neuron within the optic lobe of grasshoppers, and morphology files for 5 other neuron types. Attached are a number of files which setup the channel and membrane properties of the LGMD model and provide several example simulations.

  If you need extra help running the NEURON model than provided below please consult this page:<p/>

  Note that the mod files are in a folder called mods (see linux command below).
<p>Auto-launch or Compile special:<br/>
The LGMD model uses several custom .mod files for channels and currents. The auto-launch link will use these mod files to compile a special executable version of NEURON with the additional membrane mechanisms. Alternatively, the mknrndll application or nrnivmodl binary can be used to compile the special version containg all custom channels.
