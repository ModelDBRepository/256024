    "Active membrane conductances and morphology of a collision detection neuron broaden its impedance profile and improve discrimination of input synchrony" by Dewell and Gabbiani (2019) J Neurophysiol<br/>

It includes a detailed model of the lobula giant movement detector neuron (LGMD) which is a well studied neuron within the optic lobe of grasshoppers, and morphology files for 5 other neuron types. Attached are a number of files which setup the channel and membrane properties of the LGMD model and provide several example simulations.

  Note that the mod files are in a folder called mods (see linux command below).
<p>Auto-launch or Compile special:<br/>
The LGMD model uses several custom .mod files for channels and currents. The auto-launch link will use these mod files to compile a special executable version of NEURON with the additional membrane mechanisms. Alternatively, the mknrndll application or nrnivmodl binary can be used to compile the special version containg all custom channels.

<pre>
cd lgmd_impedance       # change path to location on your computer
nrnivmodl ./mods        # compile special executable 
x86_64/special ./mosinit.hoc -          # execute Neuron and initialize

<p>20190808 dropbox update from Richard Dewell and additional touchups to
make fig 8 button work (from mosinit.hoc)</p>
<p/>20190812 more updates from Richard Dewell to annotate and provide closer
facsimile of figure 8.
<p/>20190814a non programming edits to provide length of times for simulation runs and corrected typo in program name in readme.
<p/>20190814b Richard Dewell corrected statement:
  passive_morphologies.hoc doesn't have to be run before cable.hoc
